title: #WallOfVets Mission Statement
---
Wall of Vets is a group of U.S. Military Veterans and their families from all branches of the uniformed services.

We swore an oath to defend the Constitution and the people of the United States of America, and that is an oath that never expires. 

We support peaceful protests and people who are legally exercising their Constitutional and Civil rights; we will stand as a shield between them and those who would violate those rights. 

We are not trying to change the narrative of the protests we support. We help make their message heard by showing our support. We will support and follow the lead of the local organizers. 

We DO NOT condone violence, the breaking of any laws, rioting or looting. 

We fully support BLM, LBGTQ+ and equal rights for all.
